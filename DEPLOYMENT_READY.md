# âœ… YES! Run This Command in Terminal to Deploy

## The Command You Need:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

**That's it!** Just copy and paste that command into your terminal and press Enter.

## What "npx" means:
- **npx** = "Node Package Execute" 
- It runs Node packages without installing them globally
- **vercel** = The deployment tool
- **--prod** = Deploy to production (not preview)

## Quick Answers:

**Q: "I have to put that npx in terminal right?"**
**A: YES! Exactly right!** Copy this command and paste it in your terminal:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## Even Easier Option:
I created a script for you. Just run:
```bash
./deploy_to_vercel.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check everything is ready
2. Build your project first
3. Run the deployment
4. Guide you through each step

## What Happens When You Run It:

1. **Terminal asks questions** â†’ Just answer:
   - "Set up and deploy?" â†’ Type **y** and Enter
   - "Which scope?" â†’ Select your account
   - "Link to existing?" â†’ Type **n** for new project
   - "Project name?" â†’ Just press Enter or type **scanner-pro**
   - "Which directory?" â†’ Press Enter
   - "Modify settings?" â†’ Type **n**

2. **It deploys your app** with:
   - âœ… 4,500+ stocks scanning (not just 52!)
   - âœ… Real live market data 
   - âœ… All your API keys working
   - âœ… ML Trading System fully integrated
   - âœ… All bugs fixed

3. **You get a URL** like:
   - https://scanner-pro.vercel.app

## Your API Keys (Already in .env.local):
```
POLYGON_API_KEY=75rlu6cWGNnIqqR_x8M384YUjBgGk6kT
FMP_API_KEY=m2XfxOS0sZxs6hLEY5yRzUgDyp5Dur4V  
ORTEX_API_KEY=Q0VpvWFI.wPuSEG6CNr7uoRZbtFcmVeeXpoJvjz75
```

## After Deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Add the API keys in Settings â†’ Environment Variables
